## Installation
NODE and Express must be installed to run. The page is deployed with HEROKU, but will not require any additional software to run, just to host. 
*****
## Usage
It is a good demonstation on how to deploy with a hosting platform, in this case HEROKU. This project uses the inherent Node functions of Express and fs, which is the file writing system within Node.
