## Installation
NODE and Express must be installed to run. The page is deployed with HEROKU, but will not require any additional software to run, just to host. 
My Heroku journey was not a smooth ride. I still have not unbugged what is going on. I think it has something to do with my code breaking. I attempted the delete function and after working with my tutor with file paths, I think I got lost.

## Usage
It is a good demonstation on how to deploy with a hosting platform, in this case HEROKU. This project uses the inherent Node functions of Express and fs, which is the file writing system within Node. 
I am still throwing errors and not happy with how this is going.

## Tests
While I do not have test to run, I consider getting it all working a test in itself. While I am writing into the db.json, I am not getting it back on the deplyed page. Also, I am having a hard time understanding what is wrong with how I am using Heroku.
